Requirements
--------------
Tunes Notifier requires the following
- macOS 13.0 Ventura or later
- Spotify

Limitations
--------------
Some older versions of the Spotify app may not provide current song information when playing on external devices. As a result, Tunes Notifier is not able to present notifications or current song information in the menu bar. Please update to the latest version available.

Note: AirPlay 2 speakers are not affected by this issue.
